To learn more about publishing knowledge publicly or to other members of your team check out <a href="http://opticdev.com/docs/#/?id=publishing-knowledge">our docs</a>.

This means we’re starting the sync feature this week and we plan to release it mid-May. There won’t be any material releases between now and then, but we will push up 1 or 2 releases to address any bugs that our Beta Testers discover.</p>\n<p>After sync we’re going to spend some time making error handling less opaque and then polishing up Optic for the end of the Beta and her 1.0 release.</p>\n<h3 id="to-our-beta-testers-thank-you-for-sharing-your-enthusiasm-and-insights-with-us-day-in-and-day-out-good-stuff-coming-soon-"><a href="#to-our-beta-testers-thank-you-for-sharing-your-enthusiasm-and-insights-with-us-day-in-and-day-out-good-stuff-coming-soon-" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>To our Beta Testers, thank you for sharing your enthusiasm and insights with us day in and day out.
